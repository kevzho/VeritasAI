# Veritas AI: Deep Dive in AI + Finance Projects

This repository contains a collection of individually scoped projects created during the Veritas AI Deep Dive program on **AI and Finance**. Each project lives in its own folder with dedicated Jupyter notebooks, visualizations, and documentation.

Each folder explores a unique intersection of AI and finance, from time series analysis to portfolio optimization.

## Highlights

- Time series wrangling with `yfinance`
- Custom plots with `matplotlib` and `plotly`
- Model evaluation with metrics like MAE and R²
- Outlier detection in company metadata
- Financial insights backed by machine learning

## Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- `yfinance`, `nbformat`, `re`, `plotly`

## Notes

This repo showcases my journey through financial data storytelling, machine learning applications, and code-driven insights. It's been a blast merging technical depth with investment theory.

Thanks to the Veritas AI team for guiding this experience!
